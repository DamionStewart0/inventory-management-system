# SOME APP (INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSYTEM)


## Project Description

SOME APP(IMS) is an Airtable and React build that will allow business operators to see all their inventory in one place and will also enable the user to tell if that inventory in use or parked. The user will be able  to navigate from the homepage either by the main links (i.e Inventory or Driver) or they will be able to click on the listed cars. Most importantly each car listed on the homepage will have an active/inactive indicator to let the user know the inventory status.

### Strengths:
I have a good data base of examples from class exercise/labs, and even though i dont have a strong understanding of React. From my very basic understanding of React and the guidance(labs & example) i was given i am confident my app will be user friendly and productive.



### Weaknesses:
Lack of in depth understanding of React is the only major hinderance to this project but that can be mitigated by the following process: 1. Go over the examples we received.
2. Search for solutions online (DuckDuckGo, google). 3. Ask a Friend/Cohort mates. 4. Ask an instructor. With this simple process i will cover come any challenge.



### Opportunities:
I am more comfortable using the function component method but this may be a great opportunity to start working with class component.



### Threats:
Time, Time, Time....Proper time management is critical for the project to come out the way in envision is essential. In order to overcome this challenge i will have to maximise the time i spend on each component of this current project. Also i will need to be doing research at EOD to prepare for the next component of the project for the next day.
